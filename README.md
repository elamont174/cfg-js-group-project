# Code First Girls JavaScript Kickstarter Project
## June 2024
## Group 7 

### The Brief
The aim was 
- to work in groups to consolidate our understanding of the course material. 
- to present our work to the cohort

### Criteria 
- Get input rom the user on a web page
- Make changes to the HTML and/or CSS using JavaScript
- Use an event to trigger a change to a web page
BONUS
- Add HTML elements to a web page using the DOM
- Remove HTML elements from a web page using the DOM
- Research and use other DOM events
- Use arrays, loops and/or conditional logic in JavaScript

## What we did
We decided to create a 'To Do List' using mainly JavaScript. We collaborated using CodePen and Slack Huddle, used our course content and created the code together. We then took sections of the presentation to work on separately and put them together on a shared PowerPoint presentation.
